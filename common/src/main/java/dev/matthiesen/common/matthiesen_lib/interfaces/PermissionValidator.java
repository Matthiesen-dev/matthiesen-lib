/**
 * Interface for validating permissions for players and command sources. This is used to allow mods to implement their own permission systems,
 * such as integrating with a permissions mod or using a custom permission system.
 * The PermissionValidator is used by the CommandManager to validate permissions for commands. When a command is executed, the CommandManager will call
 * the appropriate hasPermission method on the PermissionValidator to determine if the player or command source has the required permission to execute the
 * command. The PermissionValidator can be implemented to check permissions based on a variety of factors, such as the player's UUID, their permission level,
 * or any other criteria that the mod developer chooses to implement. This allows for a high degree of flexibility in how permissions are handled, and allows
 * mods to integrate with existing permission systems or create their own custom permission systems as needed.
 *
 * <p>
 *     Based on Cobblemon's Permission system
