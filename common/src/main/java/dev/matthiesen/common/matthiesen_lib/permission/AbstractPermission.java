/**
 * Abstract base class for permissions that provides common functionality for generating the permission's identifier and literal
 * string based on the mod ID and permission node.
 * This class implements the Permission interface and provides a constructor that takes a permission node and level, and generates
 * the identifier and literal string based on the mod ID and permission node. Subclasses must implement the getModId and getPermissionNamespace
 * methods to provide the mod ID and permission namespace for the permission. This allows for a standardized way to define permissions across
 * different mods while still allowing for flexibility in how the mod ID and permission namespace are defined. The identifier is generated using
 * the mod ID and permission node, while the literal string is generated using the mod ID and permission node in a format that is compatible with
 * common permission systems (e.g., "modid.permission_node"). This class also provides optional equals, hashCode, and toString methods for data
 * class behavior, which can be useful for comparing permissions and debugging.
