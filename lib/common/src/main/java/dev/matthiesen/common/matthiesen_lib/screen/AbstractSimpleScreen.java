/**
 * A simple screen abstraction for screens that only need a background texture and no labels. This is useful for custom GUI implementations
 * that rely on other methods for displaying information to the player, such as tooltips or custom rendering. This class handles rendering the
 * background texture and suppressing the default labels, so that subclasses can focus on implementing the specific functionality of the screen
 * without having to worry about the basic rendering of the background and labels. Subclasses should provide the background texture and dimensions
 * by implementing the abstract methods, and they can override the render method to add custom rendering or tooltips as needed.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the menu that this screen is associated with. This should be a subclass of AbstractContainerMenu, and it should
 *           match the menu type that is used for the screen's container. This allows the screen to access the menu's inventory and other data as needed.
