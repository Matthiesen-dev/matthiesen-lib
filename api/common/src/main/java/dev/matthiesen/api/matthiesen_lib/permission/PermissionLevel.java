 * Enum representing different permission levels for command execution in Minecraft.

 * The levels are as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>NONE (0): No permissions. The player cannot execute any commands.</li>
 *     <li>SPAWN_PROTECTION_BYPASS (1): The player can bypass spawn protection, but cannot execute any other commands.</li>
 *     <li>CHEAT_COMMANDS_AND_COMMAND_BLOCKS (2): The player can execute cheat commands and use command blocks, but cannot manage multiplayer or execute all commands.</li>
 *     <li>MULTIPLAYER_MANAGEMENT (3): The player can manage multiplayer features, such as kicking and banning players, but cannot execute all commands.</li>
 *     <li>ALL_COMMANDS (4): The player can execute all commands, including those that require cheats and multiplayer management.</li>
