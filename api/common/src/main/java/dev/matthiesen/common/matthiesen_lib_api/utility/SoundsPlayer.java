/**
 * A utility class for playing sounds to players with customizable volume and pitch.
 * <p>
 * This class allows you to create a sound player for a specific sound event and configure its volume and pitch before
 * playing it to a player. The sound will be played on the master sound channel by default, but this can be changed if needed.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * SoundEvent mySound = ...; // Obtain a SoundEvent instance
 * ServerPlayer player = ...; // Obtain a ServerPlayer instance
 *
 * new SoundsPlayer(mySound)
 *     .setVolume(0.5F) // Set volume to 50%
 *     .setPitch(1.2F) // Set pitch to 120%
 *     .play(player); // Play the sound to the player
 * </pre>
