 * Client-specific implementation of the UniversalMetrics. This class extends the base UniversalMetricsImpl and provides client-specific data collection and submission logic. It overrides the appendDefaultData method to include a client-specific property in the metrics JSON object, indicating that this is a client metrics submission. The actual submission logic is handled by the superclass, while this subclass focuses on adding client-specific data to the metrics before submission.
 * The client-specific property added in the appendDefaultData method is "client_no_op" with a value of 1. This is a placeholder property that can be used to identify client metrics submissions in the analysis of the collected data. The universal data fields defined in the parent class are also included in the metrics submission, ensuring that both client and server metrics contain consistent information about the mod version and platform.
